# 👋 I'm Jicking Bebiro
👨🏽‍💻 A Full-stack .NET developer from PH with more than 8 years of hands-on experience in crafting robust web applications and services. 

🚀 Throughout my career, I've worked on various web apps and services, spanning from legacy ASP Classic apps to monolithic ASP.NET MVC projects, ASP.NET Core microservices, and frontend apps utilizing frameworks like React and Vue.js.
One of my areas of expertise lies in app modernization and cloud migration, particularly in transitioning apps to run seamlessly in Azure and establishing CI/CD processes.

✨ My guiding principles? Simplicity and maintainability. I believe that the best code is not only functional but also elegant and easy to understand.

💼 Currently, I'm on the lookout for exciting projects where I can apply my expertise and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create exceptional software solutions.
